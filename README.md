# S.A.D.V.R. - Spacecraft Analysis and Diagnosis using Virtual Reality

This is the final prototype for CS6334 Virtual Reality course, developed by Team 4 - S.A.D.V.R. This project is designed to help users learn to diagnose and fix problems in a spacecraft using Virtual Reality.

## Unity Scene

The project consists of two Unity scenes. The first scene is the "StartScene.unity", which is the initial menu, and the second scene is "Gameplay.unity", which contains the complete implementation of the game.

## Interaction Techniques

There are three interaction techniques used in the project:
1. Moving left, right, forward and backward using the Bluetooth joystick.
2. Teleportation to different parts of the spacecraft using green buttons in the teleportation room.
3. Object manipulation, such as grabbing and dropping wires, pliers, and other tools using the Bluetooth controller's "X" button. Completing tasks requires the use of these tools and pressing the "A" button.

## Android Phone and Controller

To use the project, users need an Android phone and a Bluetooth controller. They need to build the "StartScene.unity" and "Gameplay.unity" scenes in Unity and create an ".apk" file for Android. Once installed on the phone, they can connect the Bluetooth controller to the phone and start the VR application. They can then use the controller, keyboard, and phone's tilt to interact with the virtual environment.

## Gameplay Instructions/Flow

The project starts with a menu where users can start the game. They can play the game in multiplayer mode and collaborate with other players. The game tasks players with fixing issues on a spacecraft, including fixing damaged wires, putting out fires, and fixing malfunctioning pipes. Users can pick and drop tools, open and close doors, and check their progress on a dashboard. A rotating Earth outside the spacecraft window adds to the immersive experience. The teleportation room allows users to move between levels, and when all tasks are completed, an alarm sounds to indicate success.
